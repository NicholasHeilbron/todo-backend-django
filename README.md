# todo-backend-django
todo backend for django
Template for this project can be found at https://github.com/mihirk/todo-backend-django
The feature I have chosen to implement is to create a functionality to mark a todo as completed within a separate list
The base code I have written needs improvement as there is currently no way to call upon the list, but the function is still performed
There is also no way to check for duplicates yet, which is another oversight
